Personal Portfolio - Version 3.0

## Description

Although my original site was created in 2017, this version has undergone a thorough make-over with React. I've also made use of Typescript, which has contributed to the creation of an easily manageable codebase. All related assets have also been optimized, which has has resulted in a more pleasant UX and boosted overall performance.

## Quick Start

##### Client

1. Navigate to the **client** folder in the terminal
2. Run `npm run dev`

##### Server

1. Navigate to the **server** folder in the terminal
2. Run `npm run dev`

When both **client** & **server** are running, the application will be working as expected.
